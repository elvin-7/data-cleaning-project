## Introduction
Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset [(Tableau.com)](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/what-is-data-cleaning). According to [Career Foundary](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/what-is-data-cleaning/), data analysts spend around 60-80% of their time carrying out data cleaning activities. This is why I have felt it is important for me to undertake this project as a lot of the data we find online usually requires little to no cleaning.

Finding datasets to clean was not too difficult after a quick google search led me to [Foresight BI's dirty data samples](https://foresightbi.com.ng/microsoft-power-bi/dirty-data-samples-to-practice-on/#). 

In this repository, you will be reading about the steps I took in cleaning all 8 datasets provided in the Foresight BI website.

The first 4 datasets have really similar structures with little differences between them
